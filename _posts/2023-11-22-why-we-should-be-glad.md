I think it’s got something to do with your growth closely.

<br/>
First of all, I would like to start off with establishing the basic truth.  
If you want to be good at something, you have to learn from people who are already good, being surrounded by them.
<br/>
So, find people who are in the position where you long to belong.  
But there is a mindset, you have to prepare for yourself.  
get used to being in the inferior’s place.  
<br/>
just get used to hearing people demanding on you.
just get used to seeing many people being far ahead of you in terms of social status.
just get used to having small ground to stand amongst them.
just don’t get jealous of other people, seeing them riding high.
just give them applause.
just applaud their success.

<br/>
If you are in the mindset where you can’t be really glad with people riding high,  
then you won’t be able to stay amongst outstanding people when you’re desperate for growth, not because of them, but because of your pride and jealousy.
In the end, It will actually become an obstacle that hinders you from getting better

straight away, You will come to want to step out of the place because your pride won’t allow you to suffer from the feeling of becoming tiny.

<br/>
So, this is the reason why you should be glad to watch people riding high.
<br/>
Because, it will become the practise for you to set yourself amongst outstanding people, which will lead you to grow up more.
