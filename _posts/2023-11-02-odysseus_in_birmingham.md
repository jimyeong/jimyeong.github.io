꿈이 계속해서 흐려진다.
<br/>

님프 칼립소에게 잡힌 오디세우스.
안락한 삶이 주는 편안함은, 집으로 가기 위해 필요한 용기와 의지를 잠재운다.
<br/>

나는 무엇을 위해 영국에 왔던가.

그것은 목표가 사라진 느낌이었다.
<br/>

어느순간 부터 나의 목표는 그저 영국에 머무르는 것이 되어있지 않았는가
Isn’t it that From at some point my goal had become just staying in the UK
<br/>

Has’t it become just giving up everything and just going back to Korea, and just boasting my experience in UK?
<br/>

But Why are you attracted to such names like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, Apple, Amazon, Google and stuff
Isn’t it that you can’t just forget the dream to belong to a group that is ahead of normal people.
<br/>

No, Actually You were wrong.

<br/>
The first plan when you came to the Uk was to get in a company known by people ,Learning English. 
<br/>
From the first place, your plan might have been too big to achieve by a go.
<br/>
Toughen up.
Just tune up your pixels of dream.
<br/>
Don’t let them get so blurry.
